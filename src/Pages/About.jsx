                  Rishikesh, known as the "City of the Divine," has been a
                  spiritual hub attracting sages, rishis, saints, and pilgrims
                  for millennia. Its streets are lined with bustling
                  marketplaces offering ethnic arts, handicrafts, and fresh
                  produce, alongside holy shrines and orange-robed sadhus.
                  Further along, the road narrows until you reach a footbridge
                  suspended high over the sacred Ganga river. Crossing this
                  bridge, with the sun casting its rays through the Himalayas,
                  you'll feel a sense of coming home.
